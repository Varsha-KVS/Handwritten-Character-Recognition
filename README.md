# 📝 Handwritten Character Recognition using SVM  

## 📌 Introduction  
This project recognizes *handwritten digits (0-9)* using *Support Vector Machines (SVM). It is trained on the **Scikit-Learn Digits dataset* and achieves *97.50% accuracy*.  

## 📂 Dataset  
- Used *Scikit-Learn's Digits Dataset* (8x8 grayscale images).  

## 🔧 Installation  
To run this project, install the required libraries:  
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python scikit-learn

🚀 How to Run

1. Open Jupyter Notebook.


2. Run all cells in the .ipynb file.


3. The model will train and display accuracy.



📊 Results

Model Accuracy: 97.50%

Uses SVM for classification.


🔥 Future Improvements

Train on handwritten A-Z alphabets.

Use Deep Learning (CNN) for better accuracy.

Create a GUI for real-time predictions.
